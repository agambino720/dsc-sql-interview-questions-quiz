# SQL Interview Questions  - Quiz


## Introduction

This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer. For these short answer questions, double click on the Jupyter Notebook and type your answer below the line. 

## Question 1

What are the 4 main datatypes in SQLite3? Can we use other common types from other kinds of SQL?

Type your answer below this line:
_Integer, real, text, and blob. Yes we can, it will be mapped on to one of the main four.______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________





## Question 2

Explain the relationship between **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.

Type your answer below this line:
The primary key of one table is used as a reference or connecting point as it is also the foreign key in another table, creating a link between the two tables.

## Question 3

Explain the different types of relationships entities can have in a SQL database. 

Type your answer below this line:
One-to-one relationships are where each entity in one table is linked to one entity in another table. One-to-many relationships are where a single entity in one table is linked to multiple entities in another table.

## Question 4

Explain the various types of JOINs possible with SQL. 

Type your answer below this line:
An inner join returns rows with matching values in both tables. A left join returns all rows from the left table and any rows that match from the right table. A right join is the same as the left join except all of the rows from the right table are kept as well as the ones that match from the left table. A full outer join returns all rows when there is a match in either table.

## Question 5

Explain the relationship between Aggregate functions and GROUP BY statements.

Type your answer below this line:
The groupby statement groups rows that have the same values in specified columns. Aggregate functions are then appliedf to each group, which allows for the creation of statistics like totals or averages for each of the groups.

## Question 6

What role do Associative Entities play (JOIN Tables) in many-to-many JOINs?


Type your answer below this line:
Join tables play a role in many-to-many relationships by linking two tables together. Join tables contain foreign keys from both tables, which allows for the connection between multiple records from each table.
